# Stanford-CIP-2021-Final-Prject
This is my Final project for Stanford Code In Place, where I choose to build a vehicle detector  using OpenCv and Python.

Description- The vehicle detects all kind of vehicles passing the green line (shown in the image)  and count them. It works mainly on the videos but can be utilized in images.
